Analysis Objectives
- In the first stage of preprocessing, the dissolution process (in the dissolution tank) is crucial as it involves dissolving/mixing powder and liquid raw materials into purified water, etc., and since the subsequent process involves re-pulverization, it's vital for the raw materials to be uniformly mixed in the dissolution tank.
- There's a growing significance in predicting quality through the analysis of operational data from the dissolution tank, especially the need for proactive quality analysis to prevent anticipated defects efficiently, rather than relying solely on retrospective quality analysis conducted after defects occur.
